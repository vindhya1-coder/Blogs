### **Create Secure Backend Without Coding**

## Protocol

_Network protocols claim to connect devices to communicate and transmit data based upon set rules_ .

The internet users also come across the terms like HTTP and HTTPS frequently. Since , we meet these terms on the internet time and again, a basic knowledge of the difference between them and how they work will be relevant to know .

Let&#39;s find out!

### HTTP stands for (HyperText Transfer Protocol) .

It uses TCP (Transmission control protocol) to channelise the data on the web. The url address is found to be http :// which simply allows communication with other devices. What exactly happens is that when a client requests any message to the server it replies with a response message such as HTTP/1.1 200 OK.

### HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure(HTTPS)

We communicate on the internet from one computer to another ,sharing data, confidential information , private and public documents which demands supreme security from cyberattacks . The elemental aim of HTTPS is to provide authentication of the accessed website .Hyper text includes hyperlink to connect with other resources by clicking the link.

## Create a secure Backend without Coding !!!!

### Sounds Interesting??

In this spurious surrounding the word &#39;secure&#39; is captivating in itself. [DrawPI](https://drawpi.com/) aims to provide this secure vision of creating API in seconds. Yesss! In a few seconds of working you will witness your own API in progress .

Have a look to the step- by- step guidelines for a clear experience :

Project is a backend project you create. When you tap the +Create button, you are asked to enter the project name where the first character should be a-z then a-z &amp; 0-9 are allowed.

• The project when created is live on https://username-projectname.drawpi.com

• After you create a project, select a project to move over to the collection card.

• You should have at least 1 project selected to continue. 3.2

So here on this note, experience your questions and doubts live on [https://drawpi.com/](https://drawpi.com/) and yourself creating right from projects to DB schema screen in just few countable seconds !

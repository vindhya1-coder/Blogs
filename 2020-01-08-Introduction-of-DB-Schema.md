# Introduction of DB Schema

## Greeting Folks,

Here we are back with another blog on DB Schema screen. It serves as a table of content for your API that is subjected to store and present all the information whenever it is requested to have.

After organising the create screen , it is required to build your DB schema screen so that the working of your API goes in progress .

DrawPI supports MySQL Database,that supports its web database,therefore all your database will be dealing with data security, high performance, complete workflow control, flexibility of open source etc that facilitates the management of deep embedded apps.

So let's take a drive in the DB schema screen!!!

- The first thing that you are required to do is give your Schema a nice name and add a name to your attribute too.

The created screen will look like this below.

There is by default an auto incremented primary key in the schema **id unique auto increment**, hence the users are not required to increment using API.

The **&#39;+Add&#39;** option is displayed in the right top of the schema screen, which adds name to the attributes ,or we can say simply it allows you to add columns in the table.

- DrawPI supports int and varchar datatypes for now,but will come up with more featured user interfaces soon.

_Your project can have multiple tables as per your requirement._

# Time to add [Endpoints](https://smartbear.com/learn/performance-monitoring/api-endpoints/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20an%20endpoint%20is,of%20a%20server%20or%20service.&amp;text=The%20place%20that%20APIs%20send,lives%2C%20is%20called%20an%20endpoint)!!

- Come to the right most section of the creation screen, under the details dropdown, and select the method and URL. This will let your API to host live.

\&gt; Whenever you want to add a function in the condition block , it is important to note that use of the Object key is supported.

You can use any desired name for your object key.

- The endpoints can have any name between a-z. Let&#39;s check an example . Suppose you plan to give a name &#39;text&#39; to your endpoint, your generated url will display like this: [_ **https://username-projectname.drawpi.com/text** _](https://username-projectname.drawpi.com/text)

So with this your DB schema screen is perfectly created and ready for execution!!

You can easily access the above mentioned step and can experience building APIs in minutes . All you need to do is go to [https://drawpi.com/](https://drawpi.com/) and witness your own DB schema Screen.
